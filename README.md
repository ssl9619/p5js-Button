# p5js-Button
Simple button class. Not amazing but should do everything you want it to.

If you just want the class and want to move on with your life its the button.js file.

The class allows for a different color for when the viewer is hovering over the button or otherwise and can detect when it is pressed without the need for the mousePressed() function. This should be great if you want to just have some kind of class so that you can just spawn buttons everywhere. Aesthetically they are not great but they are great for prototyping (at least in my opinion). Anyways, it's up to you. 

Hopefully the code itself should be self explanatory. Maybe the only confusion is that the way that the functions in the button class take in the color is with the color var built into p5js.
